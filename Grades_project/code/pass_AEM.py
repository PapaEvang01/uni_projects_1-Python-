 Student Grades Analyzer - Python Project
===========================================

This program reads a list of student IDs and their grades from a text file,
analyzes the data, and provides useful insights such as:

- Total number of students
- Number and percentage of students who passed (grade >= 5)
- Average grade (overall and for those who passed)
- Minimum and maximum grade
- Visualizations (histogram & pass/fail bar chart)
- Saving passed students to a separate file
- Student lookup: allows a student to check their grade and pass/fail status

Designed to work with grade files using either dot (.) or comma (,) as decimal separators.
