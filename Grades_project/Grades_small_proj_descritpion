Who Passed the Exam â€“ Python Grade Analyzer

My first taste in Python programming!

During my second year at university, one of my tasks was to build a simple program 
that could check whether I (or other students) passed an exam based on our grades.

I developed and tested this project using the PyCharm IDE.


So, I created two small programs:

1. pass_AEM.py
   This script loads actual student IDs and their grades from a text file and:
   - Analyzes the number of students who passed
   - Calculates averages, min/max grades
   - Allows the user to search for their grade using their student ID (AEM)
   - Generates graphs (grade histogram and pass/fail chart)
   - Saves passed students to a separate file

2. pass_random.py (or generate_random_grades.py)
   This script generates random student IDs in the form 5XXXXX and assigns random grades
   between 0.0 and 10.0 (in steps of 0.5). The data is saved to FAKE_GRADES.TXT and can
   be analyzed by the main script.

These two scripts demonstrate:
- Basic file handling and parsing
- Use of random numbers
- Basic statistics
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Simple user interaction

It's a fun and useful introduction to Python programming and data analysis.
