Standard Identification – Deep Learning Mini Projects

This folder contains a series of Python projects developed during my final-year university course titled "Standard Identification." The course focused on both the mathematical foundations and the practical implementation of Deep Learning algorithms.

Throughout the semester, I completed four homework assignments (HW1–HW4), each covering different aspects of deep learning. Some homeworks include multiple sub-tasks. The implementations include numerical optimization, neural network models, and applications using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or NumPy.

Structure:
- HW1/
- HW2/
- HW3/
- HW4/

Each folder contains a short description of the task (description.txt) and the corresponding code in JupytedNotebook


This collection showcases my progress in understanding and applying core deep learning techniques from scratch and with modern libraries.
