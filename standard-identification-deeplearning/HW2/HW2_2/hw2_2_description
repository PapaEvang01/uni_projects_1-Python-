HW2 – SubHW2-2: 
This is the second part of HW2 from the course Standard Identification & Deep Learning.

It contains the following parts:

SubHW2-2: Multivariate Gaussian Samples and Classification

- Generates 2D synthetic data for two classes using multivariate normal distributions.
- Visualizes the data in a scatter plot to show class separation.

A) Perceptron Classifier
- Combines the samples and assigns class labels.
- Implements a custom Perceptron class.
- Trains using batch gradient updates and plots the decision boundary.
- Computes training accuracy.

B) SVM Classifier (Linear)
- Uses scikit-learn’s `SVC` with a linear kernel.
- Splits data into training and test sets.
- Trains and evaluates the model, printing accuracy for both sets.
- Visualizes the decision boundary on top of the scatter plot.

All code is run and visualized in Jupyter Notebooks.
