HW2 – SubHW2-1: Density Estimation and Classification

This folder contains the first part of HW2 from the course "Standard Identification with Deep Learning."
It includes 4 parts focused on dataset handling, density estimation, and decision boundary visualization.

(I) Dataset Parsing and Visualization

Loads a labeled 2D dataset from a .txt file (features x1, x2 and class label).

Visualizes the data using a 2D scatter plot.

Also parses the file manually into x1_values, x2_values, and class_labels for later use.

(II) Parzen Window Density Estimation

Estimates probability densities for each class using a Gaussian kernel.

Visualizes the result in 3D (Part 1: scatter, Part 2: surface plots).

Compares different bandwidths (h = 0.1, 0.3, 0.7).

(III) k-NN Density Estimation

Uses k-Nearest Neighbors to estimate density (Part 1: per-point, Part 2: grid surface).

Plots results in 3D to show effect of different k values (3, 10, 30).

(IV) Naive Bayes + Parzen Contours

Trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.

Plots decision boundaries and overlays Parzen density contours for class ω₁.
