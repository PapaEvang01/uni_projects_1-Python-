SubHW3-1:

A) Dataset Loading and Exploration
This is the first part of HW3_1 from the course Standard Identification with Deep Learning.
It focuses on loading and exploring the seeds_dataset.txt file, which contains multivariate data related to wheat kernels.

The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv() with whitespace as the delimiter.

Column names are assigned for clarity:
Area, Perimeter, Compactness, Kernel Length, Kernel Width, Asymmetry Coefficient, Kernel Groove Length, Class.

The shape and preview of the dataset are printed to verify successful loading.
This sets the foundation for further processing in upcoming sub-assignments.

B) Distance and Similarity Matrix Calculation
This section calculates and visualizes the pairwise distances between all data points.

Two functions are defined:

euclidean_distance(x, y) to compute Euclidean distance.
cosine_similarity(x, y) to compute cosine similarity.

The dataset is converted to a NumPy array.
Distance matrices (Euclidean and Cosine) are computed for all sample pairs.
The matrices are printed and visualized using Matplotlib.

C) KMeans Clustering and Silhouette Analysis
This part applies KMeans clustering and evaluates the quality using the Silhouette Score.

KMeans is applied for k values from 2 to 10.

For each clustering, the average Silhouette Score is calculated.

Scores are printed and plotted to observe how cluster separation quality changes with k.

This helps determine the optimal number of clusters for the data.

D) Rand Index Evaluation for KMeans Clustering
In this final part:

The dataset is split into features X and labels y.
KMeans clustering is repeated 5 times (3 clusters, fixed parameters).
After each run, the Adjusted Rand Index is calculated by comparing predicted labels to ground truth.

After 5 runs:

The mean Adjusted Rand Index is computed.
The variance is calculated to assess stability.
This shows how consistent and accurate the clustering is across multiple executions.
