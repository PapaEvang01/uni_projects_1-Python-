# 🧫 Cell Detection Project

This project performs automatic detection and analysis of cells in noisy microscopy images using OpenCV.

## 🔍 Features
- Manual median filtering
- Morphological noise removal
- Thresholding and segmentation
- Connected component analysis
- Bounding box annotation
- Area and intensity stats

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `original/` - Clean cell images
- `noise/` - Salt-and-pepper noisy images
- `celldetector.py` - Main script

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy

## 🖼️ Example Output
The script displays annotated cell detections with bounding boxes and statistics.
