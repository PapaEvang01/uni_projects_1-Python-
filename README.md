## Projects in Python from My University Journey

During my university years, I developed a strong interest in coding with Python. It started with small analysis tasks and grew into a 
deeper passion as I explored image processing, data analysis, optimization, and deep learning. 
This repository contains a curated collection of Python projects that I worked on during my studies.

Most of these were developed using **PyCharm**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **Google Colab**.

## 📊 1. Who Passed the Exam – Python Grade Analyzer

This project marked my first hands-on experience with Python programming in my second year of university. It demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and user interaction via the console.

**Scripts:**
- `pass_AEM.py`: Analyzes student grades from a file, computes statistics, and plots results
- `generate_random_grades.py`: Generates random student IDs and grades

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- File I/O and data parsing
- Random data generation
- Statistical analysis (mean, min, max)
- Matplotlib-based visualizations
- Interactive search by student ID

## 🧬 3. RNA Secondary Structure Prediction (Dynamic Programming)

This project predicts RNA secondary structures using classic dynamic programming based on biological rules:
- No sharp turns (`i < j - 4`)
- Valid base pairing: A-U, C-G
- No crossing pairs

**Features:**
- Accepts an RNA string as input
- Computes and displays optimal non-crossing base pairings in dot-bracket notation
